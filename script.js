// The inputs, by default have a very light border (#E5E7EB), but we’ve included 2 variations. For starters, the password inputs should be given an error class.

// The other variation is the selected input, which should have a blue border and subtle box-shadow. This can be done with the :focus pseudo-class you’ve learned about in an earlier lesson.

// Checking that the password fields match each other requires javascript. Try to implement this if you feel confident, otherwise just validate each field separately.
